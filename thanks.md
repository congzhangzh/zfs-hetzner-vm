# Acknowledgments

First and foremost, all credit and honor should be given to the original project: [terem42/zfs-hetzner-vm](https://github.com/terem42/zfs-hetzner-vm)

I forked this excellent work to focus specifically on Debian systems and personal use cases. Through this adaptation, I hope to contribute something meaningful back to both the ZFS and Debian communities.

On a personal note, if I remember correctly, my first encounter with ZFS was when Sun Microsystems sent me a Solaris CD for testing during my computer science studies at university. It's been quite a journey since then!
